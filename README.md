# Library-API Project üìö

<br>
<br>



<!--## Features ‚ú®

- **Add a Book:** Add a new book to the database.

- **Get All Books:** Retrieve a list of all books available in the database.
- **Add a Book:** Add a new book to the database.
- **Update a Book:** Update the details of an existing book.
- **Delete a Book:** Remove a book from the database by its ID.-->

## Project Structure üìÇ

The project consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Controller:** Defines the RESTful endpoints for handling book-related requests. It interacts with the Service to perform various operations.

2. **Service:** Contains the business logic for book-related operations. It interacts with the DAO to access the database.

3. **DAO:** Provides access to the database using Spring Data JPA. It extends the JpaRepository interface to enable CRUD operations.

4. **Entities:** Represents the entity (model) for a book. It is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate it's a JPA entity and corresponds to a database table.
